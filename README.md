Multiclass_image_classification
This repository contains a project on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for multi-class classification of images into six categories: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and achieves an impressive accuracy of 98%.
